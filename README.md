# EmbeddedMachineLearning_DetectAbnormalGait
 A project of building a device that can detect user's abnormal gaits and send alert emails when falling motion detected.

My device is designed to solve the problem that, elderly or some patients have higher risk of falling over due to the lack of muscle strength. There might not be a person to look after the elderly or
patient all the time, and the consequences of falling over might be serious if not treated immediately after the falling incident. As a result, I would like to propose a device which can track user’s gait
motion and raise alert when user falling over. There are two main functions of my device: 1) detect user’s abnormal gaits and record the walking motions. 2) Send alert emails when falling motion
detected. The system is implemented using Arduino Nano 33 Sense, Edge Impulse, Bluetooth, and Python.
